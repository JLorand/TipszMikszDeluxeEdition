        <p>If a teenager's room looks like a natural disaster, should parents simply
        <span class="blank" id="1"></span>or insist their child clean it up? Experts' views differ.
        An  author of several books about teens recommends that parents set
        <span class="blank" id="2"></span>
        so the room is neither a five hazard nor a hygienic hazard but allow some freedom too.
        For example one rule migth be that the teens don't eat in the room
        <span class="blank" id="3"></span>
        so there's no dry pizza left on the bed for weeks.
        Parents sould have teens take responsibillity for
        <span class="blank" id="4"></span>
        of their clothes and wash them. And is they don't do that,
        they'll have to wear dirty clothes which is
        <span class="blank" id="5"></span>of their negligence. 
       Beyond that, if the room is just messy, let the teenager sit in the mess and shut
       the door, she says. She recommends avoiding
       
       <span class="blank" id="6"></span>
       over the room. If you let the room go, then when you say "No" in another area that you consider
       important, they are<span class="blank" id="7"></span> to hear you.
       But a psychologist says parents can expect teen clean their room at least once a week.
        Even the worst room is not going to get that bad in a week
        in terms of insect crawling out from under the door.
        She thinks <span class="blank" id="8"></span> to get teens to clean their rooms
        is to devise<span class="blank" id="9"></span>.
        Tie room-cleaning to a teen's allowance, for example: If you expect the room to be cleaned
        up by Thursday at 9 p.m., and it's done, pay the allowance. If parents don't care
        if their teen's room is messy, they can given the child <span class="blank" id="10"></span>
        such as cooking for the family once a week or cleaning the table three times a
        week or feeding the dog. It's healthy for kids to participate in the family in some
        helpful way. And cleaning their rooms builds habits that teach <span class="blank" id="11">
